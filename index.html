        Robocon,  short for Robotic Contest, is an interesting game- cum- intellectual exercise  for budding engineers and their enthusiastic instructors, determined to  innovate and create machines for producing desired results. Participation in  this activity is an end-to-end competitive experience from concept design of a  system of robots programmed to perform according to rules of the game played on  a high precision technical Contest Area and to score a victory beating the  competitors; all this according to a Theme declared by the Host Country.  International Robocons are mainly sponsored by Asia Pacific Broadcasting Union  (ABU) which includes Doordarshan (Prasarbharati) of India as a member which has  been organizing all activities in India for last five years with collaboration  with Maharashtra Academy of Engineering (MAE) Pune, India.</li>
